#PiTemp

A simple script that monitors your Raspberry Pi's temperature.

##Installation

Before you can start monitoring your Pis temperature in your webbrowser you need to install a webserver with PHP. I use a LAMP setup. Follow one of the many guides like [this](http://www.dingleberrypi.com/2012/09/tutorial-install-apache-php-and-mysql-on-raspberry-pi/) or [this one](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Web-Server) to setup your Raspberry Pi as a webserver. 

If you have git installed on your Raspberry you can easily clone the repo into the webroot of your webserver. 

	// Example is for apache only. 
	// Replace /var/www/ with the webroot of your webserver
	cd /var/www
	git clone https://github.com/fechu/PiTemp
	
The next thing to do is to setup cron to execute the `monitor.php` script every 15 minutes to write down the temperature. You do this by modifing the file `/etc/crontab` like this:

	sudo nano /etc/crontab

Add the following line to the end of the file.

	*/15 *  * * *   root    /var/www/PiTemp/monitor.php
	
This tells cron to execute the script every 15 minutes of an hour. `root` is the user that executes the script. and `/var/www/PiTemp/monitor.php` is the script that is executed.

That's it! Now you need to wait for your script to collect the data. 

As soon as you can't wait anymore, just open your browser (the computer has to be connected to the same network as the Raspberry Pi) and navigate to `http://<Your Pi's IP>/PiTemp`.

##Configuration

You can find all configuration options in the `config.php` file. Have a look at it. Everything is directly documented in the `config.php` file. 

###Override Configuration
In case you want to override the configuration but keep it easy to update PiTemp with a `git pull`, you can copy the `config.php` file and name it `local.config.php`. This file will then be ignored by git but merged with the `config.php`. This way you the `config.php` file stays untouched.

###Email Notification
Since version 0.1.0 there's support for email notification. You can define a maximum temperature in the `config.php` (or `local.config.php`) file. If the temperature raises above this level, you receive an email notification to the configured address.

The configuration of email notification is not that hard once you've configured your Raspberry Pi to send emails. However, this can be a little bit tricky. Use one of the many tutorials out there in the world wide web. I used [this one](http://www.dingleberrypi.com/2012/09/tutorial-install-postfix-to-allow-outgoing-email-on-raspberry-pi/) to set `postfix` up. You just have to make the PHP `mail()` function work.

###Pushover Notification
Since version 0.2.0 there's support for [Pushover](http://pushover.net) notification. If you want to use this feature, make sure you have the `cURL` extension for PHP installed. You can do so by executing the following commands: 

	sudo apt-get install php5-curl

The next (and last) thing you have to do is insert your Pushover userkey in your `config.php`/`local.config.php` file. 

###Pushbullet Notification
Since version 0.3.0 there's support for [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com). If you want to use this feature you just have to drop in your API Key and Device ID into the `config`/`local.config.php` file. 


##Todo

- Support F&deg; & C&deg; in notifications
- Support multiple Raspberry Pi
- Select timespan
- Use Sqlite/Mysql database instead of textfile
- Add possibility to test notifications
- Add support for hostname/IPAddress in Pushover notification
